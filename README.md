# Memory_Matching_Game_Project
This is the Memory Matching Game Anime version. One piece is my favorite Anime, so I decided this to use it's characters.

# Language
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## How Game Works
The game board consists of 12 cards which contents the image of the Anime character. Once you visited the game page timer is automatically started to count. Once the user matched the card, the card will be flipped over. If the card did not match with the other card it will be flipped down. Once all the card will match the user win the game. The User can restart the game which reset the move and time count default to 0. Once the page will be refreshed or replayed all the image of the card will shuffle.



## What did I Learn after building this project?

After completion of this project now I have clear visualization of the HTML, CSS and JS. This Project is very challenging for me, I learn the basic implementation of vanilla JavaScript. I learned how to implement bootstrap and jQuery in project and get the proper concept about div, class and ID. Still huge hill to be wrecked to make career path and need more practice to achieve this goal.
